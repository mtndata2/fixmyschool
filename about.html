    <p>
      FixMySchool is a civic-tech platform that allows citizens to report broken infrastructure in public schools across Nigeria.
      Our mission is to amplify the voices of concerned Nigerians by collecting evidence — photos, videos, and descriptions — of school environments in need of urgent repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every report is reviewed and publicly visible once approved. The goal is to increase accountability and mobilize action from local and national stakeholders.
